## Bio

My first computer was the **Commodore 64**. My mother wanted us to have the same computer they had in the schools so we would know how to use the machine, so my father bought us an **Apple IIgs**. One day I saw Lemmings on the Macintosh and just had to have one of those machines. I saved my money _forever_ and finally bought a Macintosh PowerBook 165c.

I got in to programming BASIC on the Apple II. I had wanted to develop an AI. In 1989 there was a **Magical World of Disney** remake of **The Absented Minded Professor** with an AI called Albert that ran on a Macintosh.
_They probably put it together with Hypercard or something._ I didn't even know that the Mac existed back then...

I thought I could learn how to program Albert in my middle school `BASIC` class. I didn't realize the code would look more like this...

```basic
10 PRINT "hello world"
20 GOTO 10
```

My High School had a single Computer Science course, where I learned Pascal. We programmed `Pascal` on the **VAX** and then moved over to **MS-DOS** with TurboPascal.

In Highschool I got an after school job at a local manufacturing company where I wrote tools for `AutoCAD` using `LISP`. At the time `LISP` was heavily used for artificial intelligence, and I still had that idea in my head that I wanted to create a computer AI, Albert, that they had in **The Absent Minded Professor**.

I went to Marist College where I learned C. While there I picked up Perl, Python, and PHP. After programming in C, Python was a breath of fresh air.

I have also maintained a Macintosh machine. But at College I adopted Linux as my OS of choice. I was a big Slackware Linux user back then. These days I still use Linux, but I use Ubuntu now.
